## TODOs

### Bugs
- [ ] Mobile: Header image only shows my arm (im working on this. will think of a better solution)
- [x] Mobile: Awkward breaking of text mid-paragraph (i think i fixed this?)
- [x] Mobile: Copy email doesn't work on mobile (do we need it?) (removed on mobile)

### Feedback from reviewers

#### Kevin Merritt
- [x] I’d weave in “founders” and “entrepreneurs” as part of the leaders you can and have helped (in addition to VPs and CTOs).
- [x] I find this statement confusing and too indirect: “I've discovered that my personal mission is to foster others' professional and personal flourishing.” I’m not sure it’s grammatically correct, which causes me to focus on the grammar more than the content. Perhaps this would work: “My passion is fostering the personal growth and professional development of others so they can flourish and succeed.”
- [x] For the “Interim CTO and VP of Engineering” service, I’d add something about managing the team, keeping commitments, delivering against the roadmap, boosting morale, preventing attrition, etc. A CTO or VP of Engineering doesn’t get to only cook up the technical strategy. Often when a change is needed, what the CEO wants in an interim CTO is someone who can steady and right the ship while a permanent leader is found.

#### Diego Oppenheimer
- [x] Regarding your first point - I might add something along the lines of when is the right time to bring you in or talk to you. Teasing out the situations might be an easier way to self-select. You kind of allude to it but thinking about engineering growth holistically and purposefully vs reactively is probably the biggest strength I would highlight.

#### Ahmad AlNaimi
- [ ] I'd consider adding/emphasizing two more values that I feel you bring to the table: Engineering empathy -- you're a great bridge between managers and engineers, understand the engineering mindset and able to rally technical teams behind common goals. Organizational cohesiveness -- you did a great job bridging engineering roadmap with sales requirements and priorities of other orgs

#### Jacquie O'Connor
- [ ] Could the let’s chat button pop up an e mail or phone call scheduler instead of going to the bottom of the page?
- [x] It might make more sense to link your name to LinkedIn than “seasoned builder”
- [x] The second paragraph in the ‘about me’ could use some smoothing out.  “Personal mission is to foster others professional and personal flourishing” sounds off - too flowery almost or not authentic. You use that phrase twice.  Is that what you want for your brand?  
- [x] The second sentence in that paragraph is really long and has a lot of content but that might get lost because of its length and ().  
- [x] Under “services” listing “interim cto or vp engineering” in the middle seems like you’re angling for a job instead of a consulting service.  I might move it to the bottom and add something about helping them find their full time CTO while there.

What do we call these on the site? Testimonials? References?

- Chris is a natural leader who will make an immediate, positive impact on your engineering team’s culture and productivity. Teams embrace his collaborative approach and infectiously positive energy, fostering camaraderie built on trust and respect. Lots of engineering leaders have the IQ but lack the EQ to be effective. Chris has both the technical chops and the emotional intelligence teams need to reach their full potential. - Kevin Merritt, Founder, CEO & President, Socrata

- Chris has been instrumental in bringing structure to our engineering organization. His vision to see the current structure of the company and improving it has led to more scalable work processes, better defined responsibilities, and happier employees. His strength derives from how much he cares about empowering his employees by helping them to set their own technical direction as well as direction for personal growth. - Kenny Daniel, Founder and CTO, Algorithmia

- Chris is a people first manager who strategically thinks about placing technical resources in the right team structure. This can be invaluable in high growth scenarios. - Diego Oppenheimer, Founder and CEO, Algorithmia

- Chris has a gift for identifying strengths and helping teams form around those strengths. By helping my team members identify their goals, passions, and motivations, he set my team in motion. We are not just a high-performing team; we're a team that loves working together. I now enjoy working on the most positive, energetic, and collectively intelligent teams I have ever worked on. - Matt Butcher, Principal Software Development Engineer, Microsoft
